# Cursor plugins

## Pi (pstack skills as a pi package)

This fork adds a root `package.json` so [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) installs **only** the 47 `pstack/skills` (poteto's stack) as one package — the other plugin directories in this repo are not exposed.

1. Install:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/zeroaddresss/plugins
```

2. `pi install` turns all 47 on (~tens of thousands of tokens of skill metadata in every session). To keep them off and pick selectively, replace the package entry in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` with:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "source": "git:github.com/zeroaddresss/plugins",
      "skills": ["!**"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Then run `pi config` and enable what you want (keep `"!**"` first or pi loads everything plus your picks). Starters: `poteto-mode`, `grill`, `architect`, `blast-radius`, `bro`.

Not loaded (not pi package resources): `pstack/agents`, `pstack/automations`, hooks, `.mcp.json`.
